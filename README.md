Statements and declarations
JavaScript applications consist of statements with an appropriate syntax. A single statement may span multiple lines. Multiple statements may occur on a single line if each statement is separated by a semicolon. This isn't a keyword, but a group of keywords.

Statements and declarations by category
For an alphabetical listing see the sidebar on the left.

Control flow
return
Specifies the value to be returned by a function.

break
Terminates the current loop, switch, or label statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement.

continue
Terminates execution of the statements in the current iteration of the current or labeled loop, and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration.

throw
Throws a user-defined exception.

if...else
Executes a statement if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another statement can be executed.

switch
Evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case.

try...catch
Marks a block of statements to try, and specifies a response, should an exception be thrown.

Declaring variables
var
Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

let
Declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

const
Declares a read-only named constant.

Functions and classes
function
Declares a function with the specified parameters.

function*
Generator Functions enable writing iterators more easily.

async function
Declares an async function with the specified parameters.

async function*
Asynchronous Generator Functions enable writing async iterators more easily.

class
Declares a class.

Iterations
do...while
Creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false. The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once.

for
Creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement executed in the loop.

for...in
Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, in arbitrary order. For each distinct property, statements can be executed.

for...of
Iterates over iterable objects (including arrays, array-like objects, iterators and generators), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

for await...of
Iterates over async iterable objects, array-like objects, iterators and generators, invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

while
Creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.

Others
Empty
An empty statement is used to provide no statement, although the JavaScript syntax would expect one.

Block
A block statement is used to group zero or more statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly braces.

Expression statement
An expression statement evaluates an expression and discards its result. It allows the expression to perform side effects, such as executing a function or updating a variable.

debugger
Invokes any available debugging functionality. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.

export
Used to export functions to make them available for imports in external modules, and other scripts.

import
Used to import functions exported from an external module, another script.

label
Provides a statement with an identifier that you can refer to using a break or continue statement.

with Deprecated
Extends the scope chain for a statement.

Difference between statements and declarations
In this section, we will be mixing two kinds of constructs: statements and declarations. They are two disjoint sets of grammars. The following are declarations:

let
const
function
function*
async function
async function*
class
export (Note: it can only appear at the top-level of a module)
import (Note: it can only appear at the top-level of a module)
Everything else in the list above is a statement.

The terms "statement" and "declaration" have a precise meaning in the formal syntax of JavaScript that affects where they may be placed in code. For example, in most control-flow structures, the body only accepts statements — such as the two arms of an if...else:

JS
Copy to Clipboard
if (condition)
  statement1;
else
  statement2;
If you use a declaration instead of a statement, it would be a SyntaxError. For example, a let declaration is not a statement, so you can't use it in its bare form as the body of an if statement.

JS
Copy to Clipboard
if (condition)
  let i = 0; // SyntaxError: Lexical declaration cannot appear in a single-statement context
On the other hand, var is a statement, so you can use it on its own as the if body.

JS
Copy to Clipboard
if (condition)
  var i = 0;
You can see declarations as "binding identifiers to values", and statements as "carrying out actions". The fact that var is a statement instead of a declaration is a special case, because it doesn't follow normal lexical scoping rules and may create side effects — in the form of creating global variables, mutating existing var-defined variables, and defining variables that are visible outside of its block (because var-defined variables aren't block-scoped).

As another example, labels can only be attached to statements.

JS
Copy to Clipboard
label: const a = 1; // SyntaxError: Lexical declaration cannot appear in a single-statement context
Note: there's a legacy grammar that allows function declarations to have labels, but it's only standardized for compatibility with web reality.

To get around this, you can wrap the declaration in braces — this makes it part of a block statement.

JS
Copy to Clipboard
label: {
  const a = 1;
}

if (condition) {
  let i = 0;
}

CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3.0 Introduction
This Chapter presents Research Design, Sampling, Data collection methods, Data collection tools, Data Analysis Techniques, System Design and Development, Conceptual framework of online shopping system, system Testing, Ethical considerations and chapter summary.
3.1 Research Design.
The research design for this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, aiming to understand the usability and user experience aspects of the sophisticated expert system for online shopping. A mixed-methods approach will be employed, integrating quantitative survey data with qualitative insights from interviews and usability testing sessions. This approach enables a nuanced understanding of user perceptions, behaviors, and preferences regarding the online shopping system.
3.2 Target Population
The target population for this study comprises users of e-commerce websites. These users include customers, vendors, administrators, and support staff who interact with the platform regularly to perform various tasks such as browsing products, making purchases, managing orders, and providing or seeking customer support.
3.3 Sampling Technique
The researcher will use a combination of simple random and purposive sampling techniques when selecting the respondents for the study to minimize bias and ensure a comprehensive understanding of user experiences.
For customers, purposive sampling will be employed to specifically target frequent shoppers and those who have made recent purchases. This group is assumed to have more relevant and recent experiences with the e-commerce platform, providing valuable insights into user satisfaction, issues, and expectations. Additionally, customers who demonstrate significant interaction with the website, such as those who frequently browse, leave reviews, or utilize various features (e.g., wishlists, comparison tools), will also be included to capture a broader range of user experiences.
For vendors, purposive sampling will be used to select those who have been active on the platform for an extended period and have a significant number of transactions. These vendors can provide detailed feedback on the seller experience, challenges, and opportunities for improvement. Newer vendors and those with fewer transactions will also be included to ensure a diverse perspective on the onboarding process and early experiences with the platform.
For administrators and support staff, simple random sampling will be employed to ensure that the selection process is unbiased and representative of the entire team.

Advanced information retrieval techniques such as full-text search, faceted search, relevance ranking, and recommendation systems enhance the discoverability and accessibility of resources within the expert system.

3.6.4 Administrative and Management Functions
Administrative and management functions encompass the tools and features that enable administrators and vendors to manage e-commerce operations efficiently. This includes functionalities such as product cataloging, inventory management, order processing, customer management, reporting, analytics, and system configuration. Automation of routine tasks, customization options, and integration with external systems streamline administrative workflows and enhance operational efficiency.
3.6.5 Access Control and Security
Access control and security mechanisms are integral components of the e-commerce framework to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the platform. This includes user authentication, authorization, access permissions, encryption, data privacy policies, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Implementing robust security measures protects sensitive information, prevents unauthorized access, and safeguards the system against cyber threats and data breaches.
3.6.6 Integration and Interoperability
Integration and interoperability enable seamless communication and data exchange between the e-commerce platform and external systems, services, and resources. This includes integration with payment gateways, shipping services, third-party marketplaces, inventory management systems, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Standardized protocols, APIs, data formats, and metadata standards facilitate interoperability and enable the e-commerce platform to leverage external resources effectively.
3.6.7 User Support and Training
User support and training are essential components of the e-commerce framework to empower users with the knowledge and skills required to effectively utilize the system. This includes providing help documentation, tutorials, online guides, FAQs, and user forums to assist users in navigating the system and resolving issues. Training programs, workshops, and webinars ensure that administrators, vendors, and customers are proficient in using the platform and maximizing its potential.
3.6.8 Feedback Mechanisms and Continuous Improvement
Feedback mechanisms enable users to provide input, suggestions, and complaints regarding the e-commerce platform, facilitating continuous improvement and refinement. This includes feedback forms, surveys, suggestion boxes, and user forums where users can share their experiences and suggestions for enhancing the system. Incorporating user feedback into system updates, feature enhancements, and usability improvements ensures that the e-commerce platform evolves in response to changing user needs and technological advancements.
3.7 Waterfall Model of the Development Life Cycle
The Waterfall Model is a linear and sequential approach to software development that follows a structured and predefined set of phases. It is one of the oldest and most straightforward methodologies (Mudassar & Khan, 2023).

Figure 1: The waterfall modal development lifecycle (Mudassar & Khan, 2023)
3.7.2 Design phases of the waterfall model
Requirements Gathering and Analysis
This phase involves gathering and documenting detailed requirements from stakeholders, including clients and end-users. The goal is to understand the project scope, objectives, and functionalities (Mudassar & Khan, 2023). These requirements will be got through using data collection tools mainly questionnaires and reviewing literature review.
System Design  
Based on the gathered requirements, the system design phase involves creating a blueprint for the entire system. High-level design outlines system architecture, and low-level design provides detailed specifications for each component.
Implementation 
After defining the clear and rich requirements this step is building and developing the software product according to the defined standards (Mudassar & Khan, 2023). I will start coding and designing products. This step involves the implementation of all the pre-and post-condition of a project like the development of complete functionalities of the software product according to the requirement verified by all the stakeholders of the project.
Testing
The testing phase involves systematically checking the software for defects, errors, and compliance with specified requirements. Testers verify that the software functions as intended and identify and report any issues (Mudassar & Khan, 2023).In addition ,this will involve testing every module behaving and functioning  if they are according to the standards.
Maintenance
This activity involves modification of software to meet the customer and market new trends. Modification means that improve the system to such standards that can support today's technologies and meets the customer requirement efficiently (Mudassar & Khan, 2023).

3.8 Ethical Considerations 
Ethical considerations will be adhered to throughout the research process. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and their privacy and confidentiality will be maintained. Data collected will be anonymized and aggregated to ensure participant anonymity. Any potential conflicts of interest will be disclosed, and the research will be conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines and regulations governing research involving human participants.
